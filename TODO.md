# Todo:
- ~~Better logging~~
- ~~EVEN MORE LOGGING POWER~~
- ~~more tests~~
- ~~handle url options (By handle, I mean ignore)~~
- ~~Since we require time as a dep of simplelog, it would be nice to stop using chrono and switch fully to time. (Or use a different logger)~~
- ~~breakup main (and other) functions into subfunctions~~
- Caching (Might be happening)
- ~~host a dir list by default~~
- Log level customization
- Flag on whether to serve symlinks pointing out of the base directory (Right now, we don't)
- Better explain errors to the user (Actual error handling, don't .unwrap everything)
- ~~Buffering~~
- Fancy Graphs and Charts of performance analysis
