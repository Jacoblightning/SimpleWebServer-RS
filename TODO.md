# Todo:
- Caching (Might be happening)
- ~~Better logging~~
- ~~EVEN MORE LOGGING POWER~~
- ~~more tests~~
- ~~handle url options (By handle, I mean ignore)~~
- host a dir list by default
- breakup main (and other) functions into subfunctions
- Log level customization
- Since we require time as a dep of simplelog, it would be nice to stop using chrono and switch fully to time. (Or use a different logger)
